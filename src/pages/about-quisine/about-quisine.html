  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
    <p>
    Currently, we see a lot of food companies and restaurants involved in the business of preparation and transportation of cooked foods from hotels, restaurants and dhabas to the doorsteps of consumers.
    In developing countries like ours, the cities dwellers mostly comprises of working professionals and students, who find it difficult to prepare food themselves because of time and other constraints, so they resort to the hotels, restaurants and online food applications for their lunch and dinners.
    Although efficient maybe hygiene or even convenient, most people are not happy and satisfied with this system. It is simply not sustainable and have bad effects on the health as well as pockets.
    Similarly, there might be some households who are willing to sell food but are unable to do because not many are willing to open a hotel or restaurants with all the costs and responsibilities that the running of it demands.
    Similarly, there are many young food enthusiasts as well as veteran housewives who may find it very exciting and fascinating to serve their foods to people and gain a lot of appreciation.

    <h2>WHAT??</h2>
    <p>
    So, keeping in mind the above and many others such problems, we seek to build a platform where we could connect two groups in a meaningful manner, where the buyers could get the quality, hygiene and taste of homemade food at very affordable price at the convenience to their doorstep.
    Similarly, the sellers will get to behave like commercial units where they could own money.<br/>
    At the same time, we are providing a unique two-way process, where the buyers are not merely restricted to purchase from same mundane list of food time and again, but instead they could have something prepared of their choices, tastes and at their desired time.
